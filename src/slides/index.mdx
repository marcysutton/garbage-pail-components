# Accessibility

Making the web more inclusive <br />
**_with_** _and_ **_for_ people with disabilities**

# For people with disabilities out there: **how does it make you feel when a website isn’t accessible**?

</Slide>

---

<Slide>

> # _“It depends on the web site but I’d say I mostly feel **frustration** followed by some **anger** if it’s actually important to me.”_

</Slide>

---

<Slide>

> # _“I just get **frustrated**, but then I just kind of force myself to move on. I think the thing that bothers me the most is when **sites have really small font or bad color contrast**.”_

</Slide>

---

<Slide>

> # _“I will **leave the site** but in case of banking websites have no option but to look for help makes me feel **dependent**”_

</Slide>

---

<Slide>

> # _“Sites with animations make me **dizzy** so I just **close them ASAP**”_

</Slide>

<Slide>

> # _“I feel a **twist in the gut**. I feel like **an edge-case** no one else cares about. A **low-priority** ticket in a dusty corner.”_

</Slide>

---

<Slide>

> # _“I feel **excluded**. **Invisible**.”_

# UI Components

“Components let you split the UI into independent, reusable pieces, and think about each piece in isolation” - [React docs](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/components-and-props.html)

# UI Components (revisited)

Components bake in our assumptions about design and development, often embedding barriers to access from a systemic level

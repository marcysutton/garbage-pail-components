# Garbage Pail Components

Oh, the horror! Hot garbage has taken over the web. Carousel Cameron, Trappin' Tam, Shallow Dom...the gang's all here.. We'll turn the "bad accessibility" dial up to 11 in order to feel the pain that users with disabilities experience on a regular basis. Some of the patterns in this talk will be directly inspired from real life instances–because we can't even make this stuff up. By talking about the real-life practice of accessible web development, we'll be reborn and better equipped to create truly successful user interfaces.

This is a talk about some of the most frustrating components an accessibility specialist can think of (based on real life experiences). This originally came out of a happy hour discussion with Jesse Beach, Diane Ko, EJ Mason and Marcy Sutton at #CSUNATC19.

Note: This repo has intentional usability and accessibility problems. Do not copy!

This project was started with [gatsby-starter-mdx-basic](https://github.com/christopherbiscardi/gatsby-starter-mdx-basic) and [@mdx-deck/theme](https://github.com/jxnblk/mdx-deck/tree/master/packages/gatsby-theme).

_Note: This repo works best with [Node 12+ and npm](https://nodejs.org) installed._

1. Create a new Gatsby site and slide deck using this starter. But it's worth reiterating again: you probably won't want to do that. Check out [gatsby-a11y-workshop](https://github.com/marcysutton/gatsby-a11y-workshop) instead.
 
```sh
git clone https://github.com/marcysutton/garbage-pail-components
```

2. Go into the directory, install dependencies, and start the development server

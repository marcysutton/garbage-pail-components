# Garbage Pail Components

Oh, the horror! Hot garbage has taken over the web. Carousel Carol, Type-Ahead Tommy, Shallow Dom, Wastin' JSON, Trappin' Tam...the gang's all here. We'll turn the "bad accessibility" dial up to 11 in order to feel the pain that users with disabilities experience on a regular basis. Some of the patterns in this talk will be directly inspired from real life instances–because we can't even make this stuff up. By facing our miserable fears and burning everything to the ground, we'll be reborn and better equipped to create truly successful user interfaces.

A talk on some of the worst, most inaccessible components you can think of. Submissions are welcome! Feel free to open an issue with your idea.

This came out of a happy hour discussion with Jesse Beach, Diane Ko, EJ Mason and Marcy Sutton at #CSUNATC19.

Note: This repo has intentional usability and accessibility problems. Do not mimic!re at some point... ;)

This project was started with [gatsby-starter-mdx-basic](https://github.com/christopherbiscardi/gatsby-starter-mdx-basic) and [@mdx-deck/theme](https://github.com/jxnblk/mdx-deck/tree/master/packages/gatsby-theme).

_Note: This repo requires [Node 11+ and npm](https://nodejs.org) to be installed._

1. Create a new Gatsby site and slide deck using this starter. But it's worth reiterating again: you probably won't want to do that. Check out [js-a11y-workshop](https://github.com/marcysutton/js-a11y-workshop) instead.
 
```sh
git clone https://github.com/marcysutton/garbage-pail-components
```

2. Go into the directory, install dependencies, and start the development server

```sh
cd garbage-pail-components
npm install
npm start
```
